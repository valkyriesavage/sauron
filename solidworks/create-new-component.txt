To create a new component, we need some tagged geometry.

You can modify the appearance of any of the components in this
repository and they will work.

To add a component with a new name, modify the file "SWTaskpaneHost.cs"
in ../code/swPlugin/SauronSWPlugin/SauronSWPlugin and add the prefix
of the component's name (e.g. "rockerswitch") to the list called
ourComponentNames.  We need this to find the correct component in the
feature tree.

To add sensing for a component, you will need to create a tracker for it,
or modify an existing tracker, in ../code/src/.

To create a new component that extrudes, in the SolidWorks file you need:
a feature called "flag"
a point called "centre of flag base"
a point called "centre of flag top"

To add components to your assembly and get simulation benefits, you need
tagged mates.  The mate, described below for each component, will need
to be called componenttype-distance (e.g. "button-distance").

button : a mate between the top inner face of the button and the main body
set to the maximum distance the button can be away from the body
slider : a mate between one side of the slider and the facing side of the
main body set to the maximum distance it can go along its track
dial : an angle mate between the flag and something else
dpad : N/A
joystick : N/A
trackball : N/A
scroll wheel : N/A
