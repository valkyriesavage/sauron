It's about time we had a README here.

node/
this contains a small node.js webserver that takes OSC commands
  and forwards them to websockets.
you are expected to run this when you run the bits in code: the
  messages that come through here will be of the form

  address                   message
  /*componenttype*/*id*     *delta*

  where *delta* is different per component, but will always be a string
  slider : a float between 0 and 1
  dial : a number of degrees between 0 and 360
  scroll wheel : a direction in {up, down, none}
  button : a bool {true, false} describing if it has been pushed
  dpad : a direction in {up, down, right, left, none}
  joystick : a point where {x, y} are in {-1, 1}
  trackball : a point where {x, y} represent the magnitude in each direction

src/
this directory contains the openframeworks code for the vision system
you want to run main.cpp.  I'm not totally clear on how things are broken
up between the files.

swplugin/
this directory contains the code for the SolidWorks plugin
